# elasticsearch-curator-wsl

### Download and install the Public Signing Key:

```bash
wget -qO - https://packages.elastic.co/GPG-KEY-elasticsearch | sudo apt-key add -
```

### Add the followingâ€‰path in your /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ directory in a file, curator.list

`deb [arch=amd64] https://packages.elastic.co/curator/5/debian stable main`

```bash
sudo vim.tiny /etc/apt/sources.list.d/curator.list
```

### Install elasticsearch-curator

```bash
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install elasticsearch-curator
```

### Create a file, curator.yml that contains the elasticsearch server configuration

```bash
vim.tiny curator.yml
```

```yaml
---
# Remember, leave a key empty if there is no value.  None will be a string,
# not a Python "NoneType"
client:
  hosts:
    - [host]
  port: [port]
  url_prefix:
  use_ssl: True
  certificate:
  client_cert:
  client_key:
  aws_key:
  aws_secret_key:
  aws_region:
  ssl_no_validate: False
  http_auth: [user]:[pass]
  timeout: 30
  master_only: False

logging:
  loglevel: INFO
  logfile:
  logformat: default
  blacklist: ['elasticsearch', 'urllib3']

```

### Create a file, close.yml that contains all configuration for the action you want to execute

In this case, we want to close all indices that match the `logstash-dev-` pattern and are older than 30 days.

```bash
sudo vim.tiny close.yml
```

```yaml
---
# Remember, leave a key empty if there is no value.  None will be a string,
# not a Python "NoneType"
#
# Also remember that all examples have 'disable_action' set to True.  If you
# want to use this action as a template, be sure to set this to False after
# copying it.
actions:
  1:
    action: close
    description: >-
      Close indices older than 30 days (based on index name), for logstash-dev- prefixed indices.
    options:
      delete_aliases: False
      timeout_override:
      continue_if_exception: False
      disable_action: False
    filters:
    - filtertype: pattern
      kind: prefix
      value: logstash-dev-
      exclude:
    - filtertype: age
      source: name
      direction: older
      timestring: '%Y.%m.%d'
      unit: days
      unit_count: 30
      exclude:

```

### Execute the command

The `--dry-run` prevents the action from being applied.

```bash
curator --config curator.yml --dry-run close.yml
```

Should given the following output:

```bash
2018-09-19 15:48:27,978 INFO      Preparing Action ID: 1, "close"
2018-09-19 15:48:28,114 INFO      Trying Action ID: 1, "close": Close indices older than 30 days (based on index name), for logstash- prefixed indices.
